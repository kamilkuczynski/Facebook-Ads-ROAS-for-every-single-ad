# How to Increase Your Income by Checking ROAS for Individual Facebook Ads!

In this article, you will learn how to calculate the ROAS (return on ad spend) for individual ads within a Facebook campaign. By doing so, you can identify which ads are profitable and which ones are not, and then optimize your campaign accordingly.

Facebook has its own metric for ROAS, but it is always overpriced. If you added purchases from Facebook ads, Google Ads and TikTok ads, you would have been a multimillionaire shortly. 

The problem is that all of these systems, including GA (Google Analytics), count conversions with different attributions. 

Therefore, I proposed to one of my clients to retrieve data from the database and compare the cost of ads from Facebook and the income from the database. In datebase client's had data which shows from which ad client signed up. It can show which channel was succefful in converting to reading email and later customer.

The whole process consists of 4 steps:

I will retrieve data from Facebook's API to obtain the cost of each ad, and use SQL in BigQuery to obtain the revenue generated by each ad. Once I have both sets of data, I will connect the tables using SQL. This will allow me to analyze the performance of each ad in Excel and optimize the Facebook ad campaign accordingly.
